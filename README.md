# Surfs_up

## Overview of the analysis: <br>
The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight on weather trends in Oahu to start a new business venture; a Surf and Shake shop.  In order for this business venture to be successful and to ensure this is the right investment, invetors would need factual evidence to determine if the Surf and Shake shop can operate throughout the year before financially backing up this venture. <br>

The statistical analysis was created based on the weather data from the years 2010 to 2017 for June and December. <br>
Based on the images above:<br>
  1.  The maximum temperature in the past 7 years for June has been an average of 85 degrees and 83 degrees for December.  Not much of a difference in the temperature between a summer month and a winter month. <br>
  2.  The minimum temperature for June has been an average of 64 degrees and an average of 56 degrees in December.  Again, December being a winter month, it would be natural to assume cooler temperatures. <br>
  3.  
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
