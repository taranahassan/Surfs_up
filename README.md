# Surfs_up

## Overview of the analysis: <br>
The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight on weather trends in Oahu for starting a new business venture; a Surf and Shake shop.  In order for this business venture to be successful and to ensure this is the right investment, invetors would need factual evidence to determine if the Surf and Shake shop can operate throughout the year before financially backing up this venture. <br>
For this anaylysis, weather data has been gathered from the 9 weather stations on the island.  The data provides temperatures and precipitations per day.<br>

The statistical analysis was created based on the weather data from the years 2010 to 2017 for June and December. <br>
Based on the images above:<br>
  1.  The maximum temperature in the past 7 years for June has been an average of 85 degrees and 83 degrees for December.  Not much of a difference in the temperature between a summer month and a winter month. <br>
  2.  The minimum temperature for June has been an average of 64 degrees and for December, an average of 56 degrees.  December being a winter month, it would be natural to assume cooler temperatures. <br>
  3.  Looking at stats for both months, the average temperature for June is typically 74 degrees.  December being in winter, still has a warm enough weather with an average of 71 degrees.  The standard deviation for both months range in the 3 degrees mark.
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
